# Task Scheduling in Edge Computing

## Overview
Task Scheduling in Edge Computing is a Python project that explores the optimization of task scheduling algorithms in edge computing environments. The project includes implementations of both greedy and tabu search algorithms for task scheduling, along with visualizations to compare their performance under different scenarios.

## Features
- **Greedy Algorithm:** Implements a greedy algorithm for task scheduling in edge computing environments. It assigns tasks to servers based on certain criteria to minimize delay.
- **Tabu Search Algorithm:** Implements a tabu search algorithm for task scheduling. It iteratively searches for improved solutions while avoiding previously explored solutions.
- **Visualization:** Includes visualizations to compare the performance of the greedy and tabu search algorithms in terms of delay under various conditions.
- **Seeded Dataset:** Provides a seeded dataset for testing the algorithms, consisting of pre-defined server and task configurations.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Matplotlib

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the `Task-Scheduling-in-Edge-Computing.py` script to execute the task scheduling algorithms.
4. Adjust parameters or modify the code as needed to experiment with different scenarios.

## Examples
Below are examples of how to run the project:

```bash
python Task-Scheduling-in-Edge-Computing.py
```

## Results
The project generates visualizations comparing the delay performance of the greedy and tabu search algorithms under different conditions, providing insights into the effectiveness of each algorithm.
